# Hangman
A console-based Hangman game built with Python where players guess a hidden word one letter at a time. It provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses, tracks attempts, and displays progress. The game ends when the word is guessed or attempts run out. Simple, fun, and easy to extend.
